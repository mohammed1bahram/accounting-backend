- You can use the Dockerfile for deployment.
- On most platforms, just connect your repo or upload the code, and add your database credentials as environment variables.

## 5. Next Steps

- Add more endpoints (items, invoices, etc.) as needed!
- Connect a frontend (React) for dashboards and forms.
- Multi-language support can be enabled using FastAPI middleware and frontend i18n.
